## My process

- Create a body width then giving it a border
- Creating single price grid component contatiner, centering it within body, giving  aborder as well to seee visually
- Creating rest of the coomponent, using inspect element a lot to mess around visually/live

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned


- Don't use `<br>`, better to use margin-bottom/margin-top
- Use margin: 0 auto with position: static to achieve horizontal centering
- Min-height/width dosen't allow elements to be smaller than specified
- Need to include 'sans'/'sans serif' after font in font family if using google fonts
- https://getcssscan.com/ is cool. Copied a shadow design and button as well
- box-sizing: border-box; used to not include padding in overall height.

### Continued development

- Use CSS grid more to have this skill handy when needed
